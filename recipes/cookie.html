            <li><strong>applesauce:</strong> unsweetened recommended</li>
            <li><strong>vanilla extract</strong></li>
            <li><strong>all-purpose flaour</strong></li>
            <li><strong>baking soda</strong></li>
            <li><strong>salt</strong></li>
            <li><strong>baking powder:</strong> to make them fluffy</li>
            <li><strong>chocalate chips</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <h1>&emsp;steps towards the perfection</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Cream the oil and sugars together. In a large bowl, cream the coconut oil, granulated sugar, and brown sugar together until light and fluffy, about 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the apple sauce and vanilla. Mix again until combined.</li>
            <li>Stir in the dry ingredients. In the same bowl, add the all-purpose flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt until a cookie dough forms. Lastly, fold in the chocolate chips using a spatula<br> until well incorporated.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven. These cookies bake at 177°C and line a couple of baking sheets with parchment paper or a reusable baking mat. This recipe makes about 36 cookies, so you'll likely need<br> to bake in batches.</li>
            <li>Scoop your cookie dough. Using a 1 tablespoon-sized scooper, drop mounds of chocolate chip cookie dough onto the baking sheet, leaving about 2” between each cookie dough mound.<br> No need to press them down - they'll spread perfectly on their own!</li>
            <li>Bake. Bake these chocolate chip cookies for 13-14 minutes, or until the edges are slightly crisp and golden and the center is still soft. The cookies will seem under-baked, but they will<br> firm up while they cool.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a cooling rack. We typically allow the cookies to cool completely on a cooling rack before digging in, but you can't go wrong eating warm chocolate chip cookies either!</li>
        </ol>
