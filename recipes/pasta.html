        <h2>&emsp;creamy pasta with mushrooms and asparagus</h2>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;easy to put together creamy one-pot pasta will be ready just in 30 mins.</p>
        <h2>&emsp;cruelty-free ingredients :D</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>vegan butter:</strong> you can also use oil</li>
            <li><strong>onions, garlic</strong> and <strong>red pepper flakes</strong></li>
            <li><strong>veggies:</strong>we are using onions, mushrooms and asparagus but feel free to add whatever</li>
            <li><strong>fresh herbs, spices</strong></li>
            <li><strong>flour</strong></li>
            <li><strong>pasta</strong></li>
            <li><strong>vegetable broth</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>&emsp;steps heading pastagasm</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium pot over medium heat, add in the vegan butter. Once melted, add in the onions, garlic, and red pepper flakes, and sauté, often stirring, for about 3 minutes or until fragrant and translucent.    </li>
            <li>Add the mushrooms and cook until they begin to soften and brown, about 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the flour over the mushroom mixture and mix through. Stir constantly for 2 minutes to cook the flour through.</li>
            <li>Add in the broth and pasta and mix until uniform.</li>
            <li>Allow the mixture to come to a simmer. Once simmering, cook for 5 minutes, being sure to stir it often.</li>
            <li>Mix in the asparagus and vegan parmesan and simmer for 5 more minutes or until the noodles are cooked through. The dish will seem watery at this point but don't worry; it will thicken up perfectly! </li>
            <li>Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the vegan cream cheese, lemon juice, basil, and parsley—season with black pepper as desired. We have found that we don't have to salt the dish as the broth<br> already brings in a lot of flavor, but add salt if you desire!</li>
            <li>Cover the pot and set it aside for 10 minutes.   </li>
            <li>Remove the lid and stir the mixture one last time. It should now be thick and creamy! Serve warm with a sprinkle of fresh parsley or basil for garnish and enjoy!</li>
