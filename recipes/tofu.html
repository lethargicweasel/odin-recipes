        <h2>&emsp;steps to becoming general tso</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Press the tofu. Using a tofu press or our favorite hack for pressing tofu without a tofu press, press the excess water out of the block of tofu for at least 30 minutes.<br> Once sufficiently pressed, cut the tofu into 1-inch cubes and transfer to a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Coat the tofu. Into the same large mixing bowl, add the soy sauce, salt, and white pepper. Gently mix until the tofu is evenly coated. Sprinkle half of the cornstarch<br> on top, mix to coat, then add the second half and repeat. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Pan fry until golden. Heat a large skillet over medium-low heat, then add the oil. Once warm, add the cubed tofu and fry on each side until golden and crispy on the<br> edges. Remove the tofu from the pan and set aside.</li>
            <li>Begin to prepare the General Tso's sauce. In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the vegetable broth, soy sauce, brown sugar, rice vinegar, vegan hoisin sauce, and<br> white pepper. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Toast the aromatics. Using the same skillet that you pan fried the tofu in, saut√© the garlic, ginger, red pepper flakes, and a pinch of salt for 2-3 minutes, or until fragrant.<br> Add additional oil to prevent burning, as needed.</li>
            <li>Add the sauce. Once the aromatics are fragrant, pour in the General Tso's sauce ingredients and bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Add a cornstarch slurry. In the same small mixing bowl, combine the warm water and cornstarch. Mix together until smooth. Add it to the simmering General Tso's sauce<br> and whisk to combine. Simmer for another 6-8 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened to your liking.</li>
            <li>Add the tofu. Once thickened, add the pan fried tofu back to the pan and toss in the General Tso's sauce until well coated.</li>
            <li>Serve. Season with additional salt to taste, then serve this General Tso's tofu over rice with green onions and toasted sesame seeds. Enjoy!</li>
